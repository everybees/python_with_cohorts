# 3.11 (Miles Per Gallon) Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles.
# One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles driven
# and gallons used for each tankful. Develop a sentinel-controlled-repetition script that
# prompts the user to input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. The script
# should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful.
# After processing all input information, the script should calculate and display the combined miles per
# gallon obtained for all tankfuls (that is, total miles driven divided by total gallons used).
