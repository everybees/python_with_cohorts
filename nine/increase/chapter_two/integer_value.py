# (Integer Value of a Character) Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter, you
# learned about strings. Each of a string’s characters has an integerrepresentation. The set of characters a computer uses together with the
# characters’ integer representations is called that computer’s character set.
# You can indicate a character value in a program by enclosing that
# character in quotes, as in 'A'. To determine a character’s integer value,
# call the built-in function ord:
# In [1]: ord('A')
# Out[1]: 65
# Display the integer equivalents of B C D b c d 0 1 2 $ * + and
# the space character.


print(ord('B'))
print(ord('C'))
print(ord('D'))
print(ord('b'))
print(ord('c'))
print(ord('d'))
print(ord('0'))
print(ord('1'))
print(ord('2'))
print(ord('$'))
print(ord('*'))
print(ord('+'))
