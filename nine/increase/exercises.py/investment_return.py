# (7% Investment Return) Some investment advisors say that it’s
# reasonable to expect a 7% return over the long term in the stock market.
# Assuming that you begin with $1000 and leave your money invested,
# calculate and display how much money you’ll have after 10, 20 and 30
# years. Use the following formula for determining these amounts:
# n
# a = p(1 + r)
# where
# p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal of $1000),
# r is the annual rate of return (7%),n is the number of years (10, 20 or 30) and
# a is the amount on deposit at the end of the
# nth year.
