# (Table of Squares and Cubes) Write a script that calculates the squares and cubes
# of the numbers from 0 to 5. Print the resulting values in table format, as shown below. Use
# the tab escape sequence to achieve the three-column output.
# 2.8
# number square  cube
# 0       0       0
# 1       1       1
# 2       4       8
# 3       9       27
# 4       16      64
# 5       25      125
# The next chapter shows how to “right align” numbers. You could try that as an extra chal-
# lenge here. The output would be:
# number square  cube
# 0       0       0
# 1       1       1
# 2       4       8
# 3       9       27
# 4       16      64
# 5       25      125
