# (Target Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor
# to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your doctors and trainers.
# According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeart-
# Rates), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220
# minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is 50–85% of your maximum heart rate.
# Write a script that prompts for and inputs the user’s age and calculates and displays the
# user’s maximum heart rate and the range of the user’s target heart rate. [These formulas
# are estimates provided by the AHA; maximum and target heart rates may vary based on
# the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified
# healthcare professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]

user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
maximum_heart_rate = 220 - user_age
target_heart_rate_from = maximum_heart_rate * 0.50
target_heart_rate_to = maximum_heart_rate *0.85

print('Your maximum heart rate is',maximum_heart_rate,'\nYour target heart rate range is:',target_heart_rate_from,'to',target_heart_rate_to,'beats per minutes')
