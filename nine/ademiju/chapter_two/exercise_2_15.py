# (Sort in Ascending Order) Write a script that inputs three different floating-point
# numbers from the user. Display the numbers in increasing order. Recall that an if statementâ€™s
# suite can contain more than one statement. Prove that your script works by running
# it on all six possible orderings of the numbers. Does your script work with duplicate
# numbers? [This is challenging. In later chapters youâ€™ll do this more conveniently and with
# many more numbers.]
