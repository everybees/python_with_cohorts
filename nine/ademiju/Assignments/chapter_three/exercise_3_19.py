# (Brute-Force Computing: Pythagorean Triples) A right triangle can have sides that
# are all integers. The set of three integer values for the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean
# triple. These three sides must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares
# of two of the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Find all Pythagorean triples for
# side1, side2 and hypotenuse (such as 3, 4 and 5) all no larger than 20. Use a triple-nested
# for-loop that tries all possibilities. This is an example of “brute-force” computing. You’ll earn in more advanced computer science courses that there are many interesting problems
# for which there is no known algorithmic approach other than sheer brute force.
