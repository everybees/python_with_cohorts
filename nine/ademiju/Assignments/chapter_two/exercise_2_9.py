# (Integer Value of a Character) Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter, you learned
# about strings. Each of a string’s characters has an integer representation. The set of characters
# a computer uses together with the characters’ integer representations is called that
# computer’s character set. You can indicate a character value in a program by enclosing that
# character in quotes, as in 'A'. To determine a character’s integer value, call the built-in
# function ord:
# In [1]: ord('A')
# Out[1]: 65
# Display the integer equivalents of B C D i c d 0 1 2 $ * + and the space character.

print(ord('B'))
print(ord('C'))
print(ord('D'))
print(ord('i'))
print(ord('c'))
print(ord('d'))
print(ord('0'))
print(ord('1'))
print(ord('2'))
print(ord('$'))
print(ord('*'))
print(ord('+'))
print(ord(' '))
